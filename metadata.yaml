description: In this moving memoir of an unusual childhood, John Muir recalls his
  younger days in East Lothian with a startling clarity, depicting a wild boy whose
  quiet individuality and determination were already emerging. Born in mid nineteenth-century
  Scotland, Muir was eleven when his fanatically religious father took the family
  to build a new life in America's vast wilderness. Muir charts their pioneering years
  in Wisconsin, where his battles for survival powerfully anticipate the extraordinary
  career which was to follow. They reveal a free spirit who perceived bonds between
  man and nature that.
